README is used to display SHORT description of an application and some 
additional instructions on how to build or use the package. 
You may list additional (optional) dependencies needed to enable new features.

Some common rules for README:
- Maximum of 72 characters on each line
- Use 2-4 spaces and avoid TAB character
- Plain ASCII is preferred
- Do not include homepage URL
- Additional notes before building 
  * user/group creation along with correct UID/GID
  * strict dependency build order
  * conflict with Slackware's package
  
If you need to have longer instructions, please consider to have an 
additional README file, such as README.SBo or README.Slackware.
